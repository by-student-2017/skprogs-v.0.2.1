Usage

1. Set "r0" and "sigma" from "parameters_Ref1.txt". If the calculation does not converge, set "simga" to a value close to it.
2. Find stable basis function parameters with a good fit using the following steps.
  python3 seq_sto_v1.py
  Click "plot_map.gpl" to output the graph.
3. Search for "r0" and "simga" in density. It's a good idea to do the calculations by hand a few times first to clarify the bare minimum and minimum fit range.
  python3 seq_denr0_v1.py
  Click "plot_map.gpl" to output the graph.
4. Search for "r0" and "sigma" of each orbit. 
  python3 seq_r0_v1.py
  Click "plot_map.gpl" to output the graph.
  
Note 1: As the saying goes, don't rush, it's a good idea to draw diagrams that are easy to understand and also check visually.
Note 2: It is better to do a rough review using a map and visually, and then manually search for a place to search in earnest using GA, etc., which will deepen your understanding and reduce the chance of making mistakes.
